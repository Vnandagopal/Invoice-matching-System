# Document Similarity Matching System

## Overview

This project implements a document similarity matching system using Django. The system allows for the upload of invoices and compares them with existing invoices in the database using text-based similarity metrics.

## Document Representation Method

The chosen representation method involves extracting text from PDF documents using the PyPDF2 library. This text is then processed to compare the contents of invoices.

## Similarity Metric Used

The similarity between invoices is computed using cosine similarity. Text from the invoices is vectorized using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and similarity scores are calculated to find the closest matches.
